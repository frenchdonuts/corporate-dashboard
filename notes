TODO:
  Lock headers so User can see columns even when they are scrolling down
  Add a text field + dropdwon so User can filter issues by:
    Customer Name
    Employee Name
    Description
    Customer Email
    Do we need a dropdown?
  Add a dropdown so User can filter issues by
    All
    Open
    Closed
  Probably wrap this form stuff inside a Grid

Later improvements:
  Add 2?/4? calendar widgets so Users can filter by
    Submission Timestamp
    Closed Timestamp
    Is there a better way UI pattern o use here?
      Users need to be able to define intervals for both submission and closed timestamps
      Sliders?
      Text?

Use elm-sortable-table or stick w/ elm-mdl's standard table component?
