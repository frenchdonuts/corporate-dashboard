Key Metrics
  Bar Chart
    Add title
    Make the last month on the x-axis the actual current month
  Line Graph
    Add title
  Refactor:
    Pull common code between Bar Chart and Line Graph into fn(s)

  I like this pattern though:
    Decompose into distince Pages w/ their own Model Update View
    When data needs to be shared among pages, move it up the hierarchy
    Make sure remote data that we fetch is modeled using RemoteData data type
Geospatial
  TODO
    When User clicks on a row, zoom in on corresponding City in Google Maps
      When User clicks again, go back to default zoom (zoom lv to fit US)
    Change zoom lv depending on window size
    Style arrows so they are smaller

Issues
  TODO
    Lock filter form area and table header so User can see columns while they are scrolling down
    Allow Users to filter issues by
      All
      Open
      Closed
  Later improvements:
    Add 2?/4? calendar widgets so Users can filter by
      Submission Timestamp
      Closed Timestamp
      Is there a better way UI pattern o use here?
        Users need to be able to define intervals for both submission and closed timestamps
        Sliders?
        Text?
