Issues
  TODO
    Lock filter form area and table header so User can see columns while they are scrolling down
    Allow Users to filter issues by
      All
      Open
      Closed
  Later improvements:
    Add 2?/4? calendar widgets so Users can filter by
      Submission Timestamp
      Closed Timestamp
      Is there a better way UI pattern o use here?
        Users need to be able to define intervals for both submission and closed timestamps
        Sliders?
        Text?

Geospatial
  TODO
    When User clicks on a row, zoom in on corresponding City in Google Maps
      When User clicks again, go back to default zoom (zoom lv to fit US)
    Style arrows so they are smaller
