TODO:
  Lock filter form area and table header so User can see columns while they are scrolling down
  Allow Users to filter issues by
    All
    Open
    Closed


Later improvements:
  Add 2?/4? calendar widgets so Users can filter by
    Submission Timestamp
    Closed Timestamp
    Is there a better way UI pattern o use here?
      Users need to be able to define intervals for both submission and closed timestamps
      Sliders?
      Text?
