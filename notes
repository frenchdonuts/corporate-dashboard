Questions while going through elm-sortable-table example
  How does viewCheckbox get its state? It excepts a record w/ a "selected" field
Geospatial page
  Row should be "highlighted" on hover
    How will I get rid of the gap in the highlighting?
  How do I make it look more like a sortable table?
  Should I use elm-sortable table now?

  Should be sortable by City(alphabetically) and Employee Count
  When User clicks on a row, zoom in on corresponding City in Google Maps
    When User clicks again, go back to default zoom (zoom lv to fit US)

Call the "company":
  Massive Corp Inc.
  Over-Employed Corp Inc.

Relabel "customers" to "clients"
